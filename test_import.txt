The Old Oak

In the heart of Meridian Valley, where morning mist clings to ancient stones, stands an oak tree older than memory itself. Local folklore claims it was planted by the first settlers three centuries ago, though botanists suggest it's closer to five hundred years old.

Sarah Chen discovered the tree during her first week as the valley's new park ranger. She'd been following a deer trail that morning when she emerged into the clearing and found herself face to face with the massive trunk. The oak's canopy stretched nearly sixty feet above her head, its branches thick as telephone poles reaching toward the sky.

What caught her attention wasn't just the tree's size, but the carved symbols spiraling up its bark. They weren't random scratches made by lovers or vandals. These markings followed an intricate pattern, each symbol precisely placed, weathered but still legible after decades of exposure.

The locals called it the Memory Tree. They said if you touched its bark and made a wish, the tree would remember it forever. Children would visit on their birthdays, pressing small palms against the rough surface, whispering secrets they hoped would come true.

Sarah didn't believe in magic, but she couldn't deny the tree's presence felt different from anything else in the forest. Standing in its shadow, she felt connected to something larger than herself, as if the oak held memories not just of wishes, but of every person who had ever sought shelter beneath its branches.
